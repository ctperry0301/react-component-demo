  "name": "Simple caprese salad",
  "description": "A spin on the standard caprese salad! Traditionally, the caprese salad calls for sliced tomatoes and slices of mozzarella. This version uses cherry tomatoes, and either mozzarella balls or small cubes of the cheese. This gives you a salad that's a bit more like a salad, and works better as a side item. In addition, the cherry tomatoes are a bit sweeter, which brings a little more brightness to the dish. The recipe below is designed to act as a guide, and not something to be followed prescriptively. Play with your food! Adjust amounts based on your tastes.",
